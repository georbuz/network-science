# Practical Assignments for the Network Science Course

This repository contains practical assignments for courses "Network Science" and "Structural Analysis and Visualization of Networks" at HSE university. All assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks, that can be done by writing code instead of the line 
```
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
All notebooks contain test cells with `assert` statements that help you understand whether your code is correct.
